# Analysis of Stock Market Data Using Visual Basic

Using developer tools in Excel, I wrote a VBA script that looped through the 'ticker' names of three years of stock market data.

If the ticker names were different, the name and volume would be added to a new row in a table with total volume for each ticker name. If the ticker names were the same, just the volume would be added to the total of that ticker name in the table.

The script will run on all sheets in the workbook.

# Files in Repo

There were around 80,000 rows of data in each worksheet, so the file was too large to upload. I have uploaded screenshots of my results instead along with a blank workbook that contains the script I used that can be tested on similarly structured data.

# Notes

After writing this VBA script, my mom asked for some help with some very similar calculations on scholarship data at her work. A few changes in this script calculated what she needed in 30 seconds, which would have taken her an entire workday to complete manually (if she didn't have any interruptions). It was nice to use this for a real situation, not just hypothetical stock market data.
